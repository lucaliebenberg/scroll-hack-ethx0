A decentralized solution for two-factor authentication (2FA), aiming to replace traditional solutions like Googleâ€™s Authenticator. By leveraging Oasis, Bandada, and Near, we provide a privacy-based solution that enhances the security of both web2 and web3 applications.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Running the App Locally

To run the app on your local machine, navigate to the app directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server:

```sh
cd app
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Deploying the Contracts

To deploy the contracts, install the dependencies and use the Hardhat deploy command:
